### Running unit tests
For running tests, use the following codes in your terminal:
```
python3.6 credentials_test.py
python3.6 user_test.py

## Bugs.
There is no database to support the app since it is a terminal app. Once you exit or log out of a session you loose all the credentials and the created user account so you will have to create a new user for every session.
